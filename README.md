### Build and develop it

This website uses [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/), [nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/), and [typescript](https://typescriptlang.org) to build and host a live development server. 

Here's how to get started:

1. Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) if you haven't already.
2. Install the dependencies in the same directory as the project: `$ npm install`.
3. Install the [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) CLI: `$ npm install gulp-cli -g` (`sudo` may be required on certain operating systems).
4. Build a minified production build with `$ gulp build` or run a live dev server (usually at localhost:3000) with `$ gulp watch`.

Notes:
- Only the minified production build will be pushed.
- The code you see in the dev server will not be committed unless you build first.
